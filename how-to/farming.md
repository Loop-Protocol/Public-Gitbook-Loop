Farming is a great way to earn LOOP rewards on LOOPMarket.

## Getting prepared <a href="#getting-prepared" id="getting-prepared"></a>

Farming takes a little work to get set up.

You’re going to need some "LP Tokens" to enter into a Farm with. Farms can only accept their own exact LP Token. for example, the LOOP-UST Farm will only accept LOOP-UST LP Tokens.

To get the exact LP Token, you'll need to provide liquidity for that trading pair. So to get LOOP-UST LP Tokens, you'll first have to provide liquidity for the LOOP-UST pair.

It may sound intimidating, but it's not too complicated. Let's go through step by step.

### Finding your Farm <a href="#finding-your-farm" id="finding-your-farm"></a>

Before you proceed, you'll want to choose a Farm that's right for you. [Visit the Farms page](https://dex.loop.markets/farm2#withdraw) and you’ll see a list of available Farms.

When you find a Farm that you'd like to use, note down the trading pair, e.g. LOOP-UST in case you need it later.

### Providing liquidity to get LP Tokens <a href="#providing-liquidity-to-get-lp-tokens" id="providing-liquidity-to-get-lp-tokens"></a>

Now that you've found a Farm to stake in, you will need to add liquidity to get your LP Tokens.

1. Click on [POOL](https://dex.loop.markets/pool#provide) to swap the Token Pair to get **LP** tokens.&#x20;

## Putting your LP Tokens into a farm <a href="#putting-your-lp-tokens-into-a-farm" id="putting-your-lp-tokens-into-a-farm"></a>

Now that you have your LP Tokens, you’re ready to start staking them in a Farm and earning rewards!

### Putting your LP Tokens into the Farm <a href="#putting-your-lp-tokens-into-the-farm" id="putting-your-lp-tokens-into-the-farm"></a>

1. Go back to the [Farms page](https://dex.loop.markets/farm2#withdraw) and locate your Farm. Click on [Farm](https://dex.loop.markets/farm2#withdraw) and a new window will appear.

Type the amount of LP Tokens you would like to farm with into the field, or just click **Max** to use all of your LP Tokens.

1. When you have the amount entered, the **STAKE** button will light up. Click it. Your wallet will ask you to confirm your action.

## Adding or removing LP Tokens from a Farm <a href="#adding-or-removing-lp-tokens-from-a-farm" id="adding-or-removing-lp-tokens-from-a-farm"></a>

You may decide you would like to add more LP Tokens to a Farm at a later date, or to take some out of a Farm. You can do this very easily whenever you'd like.

1. Find the Farm you have LP Tokens in, and click the **\[ + ]** or the **Row** to view details. You will see a \[ **- Unstake & CLAIM ]** and \[ **+ Stake ]** button on the left-hand side. Click **\[** **- Unstake & CLAIM ]** to remove LP Tokens, or **\[** **+ Stake ]** to add more LP Tokens.

1. A window will open that looks like the one you used earlier to first stake your LP Tokens. Like last time.

![Unstake](../.gitbook/assets/unstake.png)

1. Make sure your information is correct. When you are ready, click the **UNSTAKE** button and confirm the action in your wallet.
2. After a short wait, your new balance will show in the details section of your LP Token pair.

## Collecting your farming rewards

Farming will bring you **LOOP** rewards over time. You can collect these rewards and use them to get more LP Tokens, stake them in Farms or anything else you’d like.

### Returning to your Farm to Harvest

To collect your rewards, you’ll need to visit your chosen Farm and collect the **LOOP** waiting for you.

1. Return to the Farms page [here](https://dex.loop.markets/farm2#withdraw).
2. Find the Farm you staked your LP Tokens in, and click the **\[ + ]** or the **Row** to view details. You should see an estimate of your rewards under “Rewards".

![Rewards](../.gitbook/assets/rewards.png)

1. Click the **UNSTAKE & CLAIM** button and confirm the action in your wallet. After a short wait, the **Reward Tokens** will be claimed to your wallet for you to use as you like.

### How often should I harvest my rewards?

How often you harvest your rewards is up to you, but it does help to remember that there is a small fee transaction involved in harvesting.

Consider leaving your rewards to grow for a while so you pay fees less often.

And that's all there is to!

**Happy Farming!**
